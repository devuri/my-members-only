=  Built-In Protected Members Only Content =

What is Members Only Content, Members Only content allows you to create special content that only your members can see.

> all post in the members-only content area is protected.

Only if a user is logged in they will be able to access, the default access level is a subscriber for all content in the "members-only content" section.

> members-only content does not affect shortcode content restrictions, this feature allows for full content protection.

= New in 4.5 =
* Present Users who are not logged in with a link to "Register or Login Here",
* Redirect Users to current page after login.

1. Create a Post or Page or protect existing content.
2. Place the shortcodes around the content you wish to protect.


New Shortcode Options Use With Options

* display="Custom text" change the message for none logged in user (default: You Must be Logged in to view this content)
* linkto="/wp-admin/" Link to a specific page, recommended usage would be to use /wp-admin/ without http://www this is very good practice in case if you are using SSL or custom subdomain, Note that this will also disable Auto redirect (default: WordPress Login Page)
* linktext="Click Here" change the text for the link (default: Register or Login Here)
