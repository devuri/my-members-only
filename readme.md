##  New in 4.5
* Present Users who are not logged in with a link to "Register or Login Here",
* Redirect Users to current page after login.

1. Create a Post or Page or protect existing content.
2. Place the shortcodes around the content you wish to protect.


New Shortcode Options Use With Options

* display="Custom text" change the message for none logged in user (default: You Must be Logged in to view this content)
* linkto="/wp-admin/" Link to specific page, recommended usage would be to use /wp-admin/ without http://www this is very good practice in case if you are using SSL or custom sub domain, Note that this will also disable Auto redirect (default: WordPress Login Page)
* linktext="Click Here" change the text for link (default: Register or Login Here)


##  Example Shortcodes

`[membersonly]
Premium Content Here
[/membersonly] `


##  With Options 
`[membersonly display="Login To Download" linkto="/wp-admin/" linktext="Login Here"] protected content here [/membersonly] `


the user will then have to be logged in to view.
